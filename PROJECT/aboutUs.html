                        Trust is foundational to everything we do. Our
                         relationship with our people, consumers,
                        customers, business partners, and communities is built on their
                        belief that we will do the right thing and live up to our
                        commitments. We take our heritage as a trusted partner
                        to parents and families very seriously. This requires that
                        we act as a responsible corporate citizen, pursue
                        social, economic, and environmental sustainability, and
                        promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. We earn trust
                        by operating with integrity and transparency and being
                        true to our mission and purpose. This is essential for
                        our reputation, competitive advantage, and long-term
                        success.

                    We put the consumer experience at the
                    center of our innovation by creating
                    products with purposeful play. We focus
                    heavily on how our toys look, how they
                    function, what materials they are made of,
                    and how they are packaged. Our
                    products are designed to deliver on their
                    purpose and withstand the test of time.
